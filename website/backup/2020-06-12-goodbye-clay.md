Some background context first - I've been playing the Animal Crossing series since 2013, starting from Animal Crossing: New Leaf on the 3DS. Villagers leaving was supposed to be a thing that I should already be used to, having quite a number of them leaving in my old game and even a few in my current Animal Crossing: New Horizons game.

I started my Animal Crossing: New Horizons journey on launch day (20 Mar 2020), and had about 5 villagers leaving my island so far:

- April 7 - Sheldon left
- April 9 - Bertha left
- April 24 - O'Hare left
- May 11 - Moe left
- May 13 - Mint left

Somehow I didn't really have very strong attachment to any of them, as most of them only stayed for barely a month. But now...

Meet Clay, the lazy hamster. He was my 5th villager who moved into my island on 24th March.

Truth be told, when I first saw him, I was really unhappy as he did not look cute at all. In fact, I think I even wanted him to move out, but it was never my playstyle to purposely go all out to make the villager feel hated even if I hated him so I just treated him as normal.

As the days passed, I gradually changed my opinion of Clay. Maybe it was because I would often find him watering the flowers in front of my house and somehow found that gesture very cute.

Then, I started to love him more when I gave him his first present, which was just a random purple sweater. It wasn't even his favourite color, but I noticed that he was wearing it nearly all the time, rarely reverting back to his default shirt.

His design, while still not that cute IMO, also grew on me gradually. His "voice" was a pretty cute high pitched sound, and as a hamster, he still looked kinda cute, being small and round.

On 23rd May, a miracle happened. I was just giving Clay a random present with zero expectations, and then he suddenly gifted me his photo!

I guess photos are kind of a rare thing in this game, since the villager will only give it to you if you've maximized the invisible friendship meter and even so, it's still a random and low chance.

I was actually expecting the other 3 older animals to give me their photos first, so I was really surprised but very happy to receive my first photo from Clay.

Then today, on 12th June, I went to talk to Clay while he was hiding behind some building, so I didn't even know he had the infamous speech bubble on his head. To my surprise, he suggested about leaving my island.

After pondering for a while, I decided to make the hard choice to respect his decision to leave, even though he was my only lazy villager left.

This guy always says the sweetest stuff, and this line really moved me to tears. I'm not sure if I'm already regretting my decision, but it's OK. Looking from another perspective, the game actually kind of mirrors real life where people just come and go during the course of your life.

Here's hoping that Nintendo will have some future update where you can see your old villagers again. THe 3DS game did, so I don't see why not. Still, it's a very slim chance but one can dream.

Thanks for all the memories, Clay. :')
