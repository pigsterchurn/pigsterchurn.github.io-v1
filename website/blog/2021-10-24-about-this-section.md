## Introduction

I decided to try jotting down some quick reviews on my game experiences.

## What about Tumblr?

This is mainly for reviewing games and peripherals, while Tumblr is more for random rantings and other topics that do not fit here.

## Disclaimers

- Don't expect professional reviews here - you can easily find those elsewhere
- This is more of my personal opinions on my game experiences
- They are meant to be bite-sized (a few minutes of reading time each)
