## Gameplay

Notes are found on the "rails", and the avatar basically zooms on these rails. You need to input the buttons when the avatar reaches the notes, and there's different types of inputs.

## Likes

I think this is the first rhythm game where I feel that even Easy is quite challenging. Also, I only bought this because of the Vocaloid songs on it. Very happy that there are also songs by Gumi and IA on it, which are usually not included in the Project Diva games sadly.

Some may not like this, but I like the mission thing as it gives a sense of progression. The song comes with 100 songs (which is a lot actually), but 29 have to be unlocked through these missions, alongside other things like navigators and avatars.

There's local multiplayer too, but I'm mainly playing this by myself anyway.

## Dislikes

No online multiplayer, although it's not like I have friends to play this with.

Also, I find that whenever I start up the game, only the first loading time feels very long. Quite not used to it as other Switch games don't have this issue, but it's just a minor gripe.

Not a big fan of the "ad-lib" notes, which are basically invisible notes. You have to guess where they are based on the music, so it's hard to get 100%. At least they are optional.

The background that shows when a song is playing may have too many animations at times, which can be distracting and makes the notes hard to see.

## Additional thoughts

Actually I first encountered this game in a local arcade a long time ago. Unfortunately, I can no longer find it so at least I can play this whenever I want to now.

Overall, I find it quite enjoyable and would definitely be playing this for weeks. Unfortunately, the price is really steep. I wasn't willing to buy until the sale and even with the discount, it still feels quite pricey. Not to mention that additional DLC song packs are over $20 after converting to my local currency...

The game is also on Steam for a much lower price, but I think there's significantly lesser songs. Plus, I wanted to buy on the Switch for portability reasons.
