## A little more about myself...

- An ordinary, perpetually sad and ambitionless individual who has a full-time job
- Been playing video games since the PS1 era and is probably one of my very few hobbies
- These days, I'm more into rhythm games (hence why there's a specific section for it <a href="/rhythmgames">here</a>)

## Why rhythm games?
- Earliest brush with rhythm games was Guitar Hero III (yes I had the plastic guitar)
- Getting a sense of satisfaction when being able to beat hard songs
- Due to being busy with real life, rhythm games is perfect for quick, short bursts
- Can basically play them forever because beating high scores is an eternal journey

## Why this website?
- I started this website on Jun 19, 2020 as a random side coding project
- Motivation was to keep track of my Project Diva: Mega Mix high scores with recordings
- Then, I began recording other video games as well
- There's also a section for bite-sized reviews of the games played <a href="/blog/">here</a>
